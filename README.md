## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am AndrÃ© Silva, a postdoctoral researcher at the Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica e CiÃªncias do EspaÃ§o. My research spans instrumentation and exoplanetary science. I am currently working on the PoET solar telescope, leading the development of its observation software. In parallel, I focus on the development of novel algorithms for precise radial velocity extraction and analyze systematic effects that impact such measurements.
